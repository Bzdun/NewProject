Carnegie Steel Company was a steel producing company created by Andrew Carnegie to manage business at his steel mills in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area in the late 19th century. Because of Carnegie, it now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and armor plate for the US Navy, which paid far higher prices for the premium product. Carnegie installed improved systems that greatly sped up the process of steelmaking and allowed the production of far vaster quantities of the product. As the mills expanded labor force, especially the less skilled workers, grew rapidly.

One suggested theory is that the evolution of plants caused an increase in erosion because they became taller and acquired deeper roots. This would have in turn fertilized the oceans very suddenly, causing large algal blooms that resulted in large anoxic events, suffocating marine life. In addition, the additional plant matter would have sequestered a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere, causing a glaciation.

This reduction in greenhouse gases caused temperatures to plummet to an extraordinary degree, causing a global winter that only subsided after enough CO2 had been returned to the atmosphere by volcanoes.
